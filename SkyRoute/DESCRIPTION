IDEA: 
Find the shortest path between two landmarks  
by return the nearest metro station and Destination station
and shortest path between them

This Project is applied to Graph Traversal BFS and DFS using python.

this project contain some classes:

skyroute:
is the main class which contains functions i create to develop the project

graph_search:
which contain the impelentation of BFS and DFS algorithms that i used in project

landmark_choices:
a list if charachters which the user should input mapped to Landmarks

vc_landmarks:
lanmarks mapped to metro stations in this landmark

vc_metro:
every station and stations can be reached by this station
